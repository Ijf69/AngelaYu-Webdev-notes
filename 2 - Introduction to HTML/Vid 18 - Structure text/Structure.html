    <p>As a beginner web developer with 3 months of experience, I got my hand on some projects, learning & delivering cutting edge technologies that drive online growth and user engagement. My biggest achievements include designing and developing scale-able web applications, optimizing site performance, and creating intuitive user interfaces. With a strong command over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and proficiency in frameworks like React, I bring a relentless passion for innovation, problem-solving, and pixel-perfect design to every project I undertake.</p>
